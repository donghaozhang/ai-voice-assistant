# Voice Agent

A voice-activated AI assistant that can record audio, transcribe speech, generate intelligent responses using CrewAI, and speak back using text-to-speech.

## Features

- üéôÔ∏è **Voice Recording**: Records audio input from microphone
- üó£Ô∏è **Speech Transcription**: Converts speech to text using OpenAI Whisper
- üß† **AI Response**: Generates contextual responses using CrewAI agents
- üí≠ **Memory**: Remembers conversations using mem0 for personalized responses
- üîä **Text-to-Speech**: Speaks responses using ElevenLabs voice synthesis

## Setup

### 1. Activate Conda Environment

**IMPORTANT**: This project requires the `ai-researcher` conda environment to run properly.

```bash
# Activate the required conda environment
conda activate ai-researcher
```

If you don't have the `ai-researcher` environment, create it first:
```bash
# Create the environment with Python 3.10
conda create -n ai-researcher python=3.10
conda activate ai-researcher
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your API keys:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   MEM0_API_KEY=your_mem0_api_key_here
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
   ```

### 4. Get API Keys

- **OpenAI**: Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Mem0**: Sign up and get your API key from [Mem0 App](https://app.mem0.ai/)
- **ElevenLabs**: Get your API key from [ElevenLabs API Keys](https://elevenlabs.io/app/api-keys)

### 5. Run the Voice Agent

**Always ensure the conda environment is activated before running:**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the correct environment
conda activate ai-researcher

# Run the enhanced version with memory
python voice_agent_original.py

# Or run the basic version
python voice_agent.py
```

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior by editing the `.env` file:

```env
# Optional Configuration
USER_ID=voice_user              # Unique identifier for memory storage
RECORDING_DURATION=4            # Recording duration in seconds
VOICE_ID=pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB   # ElevenLabs voice ID (Adam voice)
```

## Usage

1. **Activate the conda environment**: `conda activate ai-researcher`
2. Run the script
3. Speak when prompted (it records for 4 seconds by default)
4. The assistant will transcribe, process, and respond
5. Say "quit" or "exit" to stop

## Files

- `voice_agent_original.py` - Enhanced version with mem0 memory integration
- `voice_agent.py` - Basic version without memory
- `tests/` - Individual component tests
- `.env` - Your API keys (create from `.env.example`)
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables

## Troubleshooting

1. **Environment Issues**: Make sure you have activated the `ai-researcher` conda environment
2. **Audio Issues**: Make sure your microphone is working and accessible
3. **API Key Errors**: Verify all API keys are correctly set in `.env`
4. **Memory Errors**: Check your mem0 API key and account status
5. **TTS Errors**: Verify your ElevenLabs API key and voice ID

### Testing Environment Setup

When running tests, also ensure the conda environment is activated:

```bash
conda activate ai-researcher
python tests/run_all_tests.py
```

## Security Note

Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore` for safety.
